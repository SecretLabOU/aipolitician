{"name": "Donald Trump", "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "raw_content": "\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who is the 47th president of the United States . A member of the Republican Party , he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\nBorn in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization , and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s, he began side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice . A political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton .\nIn his first term , Trump imposed a travel ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, expanded the U.S.–Mexico border wall , and implemented a family separation policy . He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , and appointed three Supreme Court justices . In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program, began a trade war with China , and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without reaching a deal on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic , he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act stimulus. Trump was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history.\nTrump is the central figure of Trumpism . Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, or misogynistic. He has made false and misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden , Trump attempted to overturn the outcome , culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. In 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud , and in 2024, he was found guilty of falsifying business records , making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris , Trump was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge , and two other felony indictments against him were dismissed.\nTrump began his second term by pardoning around 1,500 January 6 rioters , initiating mass layoffs of the federal workforce , and imposing tariffs including starting a trade war with Mexico and Canada . Trump's broad and extensive use of executive orders has drawn numerous lawsuits challenging their legality.\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens , the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump . [ 1 ] He is of German and Scottish descent. [ 2 ] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne , Fred Jr. , and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert , in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. [ 3 ] Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire at age eight by contemporary standards. [ a ] [ 4 ]\nTrump attended the private Kew-Forest School through seventh grade. He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business. His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy , a private boarding school, to complete secondary school. [ 5 ] Trump considered a show business career but instead in 1964 enrolled at Fordham University . [ 6 ] Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]\nHe was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of bone spurs in his heels. [ 9 ]\nStarting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand . [ 12 ] Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer , lawyer, and mentor [ 13 ] for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s. [ 14 ] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $708 million in 2024) [ 15 ] over its charges that Trump's properties had racially discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate; four years later, Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree. [ 16 ] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win. [ 17 ] Helping Trump projects, [ 18 ] Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions. [ 19 ] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government. [ 20 ] Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey , and the Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts company. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]\nIn 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply &amp; Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units. [ 23 ]\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel , adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. [ 25 ] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt , guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan. [ 11 ] [ 26 ] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel , [ 27 ] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower , a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. [ 28 ] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019. [ 29 ] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks. [ 30 ] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property. [ 31 ]\nIn 1995, he defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a \"vast and humiliating restructuring\" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead\". [ 32 ] In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street , later rebranded as the Trump Building. [ 34 ] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South . [ 35 ] Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago which opened in 2008. In 2024, The New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return. [ 36 ]\nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza , a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation . [ 37 ] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control. [ 38 ] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle . [ 39 ] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. [ 40 ] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal . It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990. [ 37 ] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance. [ 41 ] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess , which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses. [ 42 ] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza. [ 43 ] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership. [ 37 ] He remained chairman until 2009. [ 44 ]\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. [ 45 ] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence. [ 46 ] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019. [ 29 ] He began building and buying golf courses in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016. [ 47 ]\nThe Trump Organization often licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings. [ 48 ] Over 50 licensing or management deals involved Trump's name, generating at least $59 million for his companies. [ 49 ] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name. [ 48 ] During the 2000s, Trump licensed his name to residential property developments worldwide, 40 of which were never built. [ 50 ]\nIn 1970, Trump invested $70,000 to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy. [ 51 ] In September 1983, he purchased the New Jersey Generals , a team in the United States Football League . After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the National Football League [NFL] for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit. [ 52 ] Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall . [ 37 ] [ 53 ] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia . [ 54 ] From 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit, [ 55 ] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail . [ 56 ] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\". [ 55 ]\nIn 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle , financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $1010 million in 2024) [ 15 ] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992. [ 57 ] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks. [ 58 ] In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA . [ 59 ] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe. [ 62 ] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants. [ 63 ]\nIn 2005, Trump cofounded Trump University , a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. [ 64 ] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students. [ 65 ] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases. [ 66 ]\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988. [ 67 ] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity, [ 68 ] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon . [ 69 ] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups, [ 70 ] and charities that held events at Trump properties. [ 68 ] In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion . [ 71 ] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general said the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately. [ 72 ] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved. [ 73 ] In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties. [ 74 ] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities. [ 75 ] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign. [ 76 ]\nAccording to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions. [ 77 ] While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy , his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009. [ 78 ] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties. [ 78 ] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion. [ 79 ] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank , declined to lend to him. [ 80 ] After the January 6 Capitol attack , the bank decided not to do business with him or his company in the future. [ 81 ]\nTrump has said he began his career with \"a small loan of a million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest. [ 82 ] He borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely did not repay the loans, and received another $413 million (2018 equivalent, adjusted for inflation) from his father's company. [ 83 ] [ 23 ] Posing as a Trump Organization official named \" John Barron \", Trump called journalist Jonathan Greenberg in 1984, trying to get a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. [ 84 ] Trump self-reported his net worth over a wide range: from a low of minus $900 million in 1990, [ b ] to a high of $10 billion in 2015. [ 87 ] In 2024, Forbes estimated his net worth at $2.3 billion and ranked him the 1,438th wealthiest person in the world. [ 88 ]\nTrump has published 19 books under his name, most written or cowritten by ghostwriters . [ 89 ] His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller , and was credited by The New Yorker with making Trump famous as an \"emblem of the successful tycoon\". [ 90 ] The book was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz , who is credited as a coauthor. Trump had cameos in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001. [ 91 ] Starting in the 1990s, Trump appeared 24 times as a guest on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show . [ 92 ] He had his own short-form talk radio program, Trumped! , from 2004 to 2008. [ 93 ] From 2011 until 2015, he was a guest commentator on Fox &amp; Friends . [ 94 ] In 2021, Trump, who had been a member since 1989, resigned from SAG-AFTRA to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January 6 attack. [ 95 ] Two days later, the union permanently barred him. [ 96 ]\nProducer Mark Burnett made Trump a television star [ 97 ] when he created The Apprentice , which Trump hosted from 2004 to 2015 (including variant The Celebrity Apprentice ). On the shows, he was a superrich chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"you're fired\". The New York Times called his portrayal \"a highly flattering, highly fictionalized version\" of himself. [ 98 ] The shows remade Trump's image for millions of viewers nationwide. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million. [ 100 ]\nTrump registered as a Republican in 1987; [ 101 ] a member of the Independence Party , the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party , in 1999; [ 102 ] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.

{"name": "Donald Trump", "source_url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Trump", "raw_content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\nDonald Trump (born June 14, 1946, New York , New York, U.S.) is the 45th and 47th president of the United States (2017–21; 2025– ). Following his inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump became only the second president to serve two nonconsecutive terms, the first being Grover Cleveland (1885–89; 1893–97). In January 2025, upon his sentencing without punishment for a felony conviction in 2024, Trump officially became the first convicted felon to be elected president. At age 78, Trump is the oldest person to win the office.\nTrump’s conviction took place on May 30, 2024, when a New York state jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment in 2016 to the adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump in 2006. He had also been indicted on dozens of other federal and state charges in cases relating to his efforts to overturn his defeat in the presidential election of 2020 and his removal of numerous classified documents from the White House upon leaving office. Following Trump’s election to a second term, special counsel Jack Smith , who led both federal criminal cases against Trump, requested that the election-related charges against Trump be dropped and that Trump be removed from the group of codefendants in the classified documents case. Smith’s decisions reflected a Justice Department policy that prohibits the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\nTrump was also found liable in a major civil suit alleging business fraud in New York state and in two civil suits accusing him of sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nTrump is the third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice—once (in 2019) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine scandal and once (in 2021) for “incitement of insurrection” in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Both of Trump’s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S. Senate .\nAfter the midterm elections of 2022, Trump declared his intention to run for a second term, and in primary elections in early 2024 he accumulated enough delegates to win his party’s nomination, despite the steady progress of the legal cases against him. Although some Republican Party leaders worried that a criminal trial could seriously weaken Trump’s appeal to moderate Republican and independent voters, others took the hopeful view that Trump would use his court appearances to solidify his support by casting himself as a political martyr—the victim of Democratic -led “witch hunts,” “hoaxes,” and “scams,” as he frequently characterized the many legal investigations he faced.\nTrump is also a real estate developer and businessman who has owned, managed, or licensed his name to hotels , casinos , golf courses, resorts, and residential properties in the New York City area and around the world. Since the 1980s Trump has lent his name to scores of retail ventures—including branded lines of clothing, cologne, food, and furniture . In the early 21st century his private conglomerate , the Trump Organization , comprised some 500 companies involved in a wide range of businesses, including hotels and resorts, residential properties, merchandise, and entertainment and television .\nTrump was the fourth of five children of Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump, a successful real estate developer, and Mary MacLeod. Donald’s eldest sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, eventually served as a U.S. district court judge (1983–99) and later as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit until her retirement in 2011. His elder brother, Frederick, Jr. (Freddy), worked briefly for their father’s business before becoming an airline pilot in the 1960s. Freddy’s alcoholism led to his early death in 1981, at the age of 43.\nBeginning in the late 1920s, Fred Trump built hundreds of single-family houses and row houses in the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City, and from the late 1940s he built thousands of apartment units, mostly in Brooklyn, using federal loan guarantees designed to stimulate the construction of affordable housing . During World War II he also built federally backed housing for naval personnel and shipyard workers in Virginia and Pennsylvania . In 1954 Fred was investigated by the Senate Banking Committee for allegedly abusing the loan-guarantee program by deliberately overestimating the costs of his construction projects to secure larger loans from commercial banks , enabling him to keep the difference between the loan amounts and his actual construction costs. In testimony before the Senate committee in 1954, Fred admitted that he had built the Beach Haven apartment complex in Brooklyn for $3.7 million less than the amount of his government-insured loan. Although he was not charged with any crime, he was thereafter unable to obtain federal loan guarantees. A decade later a New York state investigation found that Fred had used his profit on a state-insured construction loan to build a shopping center that was entirely his own property. He eventually returned $1.2 million to the state but was thereafter unable to obtain state loan guarantees for residential projects in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn.\nDonald Trump attended New York Military Academy (1959–64), a private boarding school; Fordham University in the Bronx (1964–66); and the University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (1966–68), where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics . In 1968, during the Vietnam War , he secured a diagnosis of bone spurs, which qualified him for a medical exemption from the military draft (he had earlier received four draft deferments for education). Upon his graduation Trump began working full-time for his father’s business, helping to manage its holdings of rental housing, then estimated at between 10,000 and 22,000 units. In 1974 he became president of a conglomeration of Trump-owned corporations and partnerships, which he later named the Trump Organization.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, Trump-owned housing developments in New York City, Cincinnati , Ohio , and Norfolk , Virginia , were the target of several complaints of racial discrimination against African Americans and other minority groups. In 1973 Fred and Donald Trump, along with their company, were sued by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act (1968) in the operation of 39 apartment buildings in New York City. The Trumps initially countersued the Justice Department for $100 million, alleging harm to their reputations. The suit was settled two years later under an agreement that did not require the Trumps to admit guilt.\nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, Donald Trump greatly expanded his father’s business by investing in luxury hotels and residential properties and by shifting its geographic focus to Manhattan and later to Atlantic City , New Jersey . In doing so, he relied heavily on loans, gifts, and other financial assistance from his father, as well as on his father’s political connections in New York City. In 1976 he purchased the decrepit Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Station under a complex profit-sharing agreement with the city that included a 40-year property tax abatement, the first such tax break granted to a commercial property in New York City. Relying on a construction loan guaranteed by his father and the Hyatt Corporation, which became a partner in the project, Trump refurbished the building and reopened it in 1980 as the 1,400-room Grand Hyatt Hotel. In 1983 he opened Trump Tower , an office, retail, and residential complex constructed in partnership with the Equitable Life Assurance Company. The 58-story building on 56th Street and Fifth Avenue eventually contained Trump’s Manhattan residence and the headquarters of the Trump Organization. Other Manhattan properties developed by Trump during the 1980s include the Trump Plaza residential cooperative (1984), the Trump Parc luxury condominium complex (1986), and the 19-story Plaza Hotel (1988), a historic landmark for which Trump paid more than $400 million.\nIn the 1980s Trump invested heavily in the casino business in Atlantic City, where his properties eventually included Harrah’s at Trump Plaza (1984, later renamed Trump Plaza), Trump’s Castle Casino Resort (1985), and the Trump Taj Mahal (1990), then the largest casino in the world. During that period Trump also purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the short-lived U.S. Football League; Mar-a-Lago , a 118-room mansion in Palm Beach , Florida, built in the 1920s by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post; a 282-foot yacht , then the world’s second largest, which he named the Trump Princess ; and an East Coast air-shuttle service, which he called Trump Shuttle.\nIn 1977 Trump married Ivana Zelníčková Winklmayr, a Czech model, with whom he had three children— Donald, Jr. , Ivanka , and Eric—before the couple divorced in 1992. Their married life, as well as Trump’s business affairs, were a staple of the tabloid press in New York City during the 1980s. Trump married the American actress Marla Maples after she gave birth to Trump’s fourth child, Tiffany, in 1993. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1999. In 2005 Trump married the Slovene model Melania Knauss, and their son, Barron, was born the following year. Melania Trump became the second foreign-born first lady of the United States upon Trump’s inauguration as president in 2017.\nWhen the U.S. economy fell into recession in 1990, many of Trump’s businesses suffered, and he soon had trouble making payments on his approximately $5 billion debt, some $900 million of which he had personally guaranteed. Under a restructuring agreement with several banks, Trump was forced to surrender his airline, which was taken over by US Airways in 1992; to sell the Trump Princess ; to take out second or third mortgages on nearly all of his properties and to reduce his ownership stakes in them; and to commit himself to living on a personal budget of $450,000 a year. Despite those measures, the Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and two other casinos owned by Trump, as well as his Plaza Hotel in New York City, went bankrupt in 1992. Following those setbacks, most major banks refused to do any further business with him. Estimates of Trump’s net worth during this period ranged from $1.7 billion to minus $900 million."},
