## Project Overview

AI Politician is a research project featuring fine-tuned Mistral-7B language models that emulate Donald Trump's and Joe Biden's speaking styles, discourse patterns, and policy positions. The system enables users to interact with AI versions of both political figures through:

- Direct chat conversations
- Simulated debates on political topics
- Fact-checking through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system

## Technologies

- **Base Models**: [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
- **Fine-tuning**: Custom LoRA adapters using PEFT
- **Language Framework**: LangChain and LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **RAG System**: ChromaDB vector database with SentenceTransformers
- **Optimization**: 4-bit quantization for efficient inference

## Key Features

- **Personality-based Response Generation**: Distinct communication styles of Trump and Biden
- **Debate System**: Moderated debates with fact-checking
- **RAG Integration**: Real-time knowledge retrieval for factual accuracy
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple command-line tools for different interaction modes

## Pretrained Models

The models are hosted on Hugging Face:

- [Trump Model (nnat03/trump-mistral-adapter)](https://huggingface.co/nnat03/trump-mistral-adapter)
- [Biden Model (nnat03/biden-mistral-adapter)](https://huggingface.co/nnat03/biden-mistral-adapter)

These are LoRA adapters designed to be applied to the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 base model.
