  <b>An advanced AI system for simulating political discourse through natural language processing</b>
</p>

---

## Overview

AI Politician is a cutting-edge research project leveraging fine-tuned Mistral-7B language models to faithfully recreate the speaking styles, discourse patterns, and policy positions of prominent political figures. The system creates an immersive experience for users to engage with AI representations through:

- **Interactive Conversations** ‚Äî Direct one-on-one dialogues with political figures
- **Dynamic Debates** ‚Äî Realistic simulations of political discussions on contemporary issues
- **Fact-Validated Responses** ‚Äî Knowledge retrieval through advanced RAG technology

## Technology Stack

- **Foundation**: [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) base models
- **Personalization**: Custom LoRA adapters with PEFT for efficient fine-tuning
- **Orchestration**: LangChain and LangGraph for complex workflow management
- **Knowledge Base**: ChromaDB vector database with SentenceTransformers embeddings
- **Performance**: 4-bit quantization enabling efficient inference on consumer hardware

## Quick Start

```bash
# Chat with Biden
python aipolitician.py chat biden

# Chat with Trump
python aipolitician.py chat trump

# Run a moderated debate
python aipolitician.py debate --topic "Climate Change"
```

## Pretrained Models
