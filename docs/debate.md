The AI Politician Debate System simulates political debates between AI versions of politicians. The system orchestrates structured exchanges, manages topics, provides fact-checking, and creates a realistic debate experience.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The debate system is built on these key components:

1. **LangGraph Workflow**:
   - A directed graph that manages the flow of the debate
   - Handles turn-taking, interruptions, and topic transitions
   - Provides fact-checking and moderator intervention

2. **Agent Roles**:
   - **Moderator**: Controls the debate, introduces topics, and ensures fair time allocation
   - **Debaters**: AI Politicians (Biden, Trump) who respond to topics and each other
   - **Fact Checker**: Verifies statements and provides corrections
   - **Topic Manager**: Selects and transitions between subtopics

3. **Integration**:
   - Uses the same politician models as the chat system
   - Incorporates RAG for factual grounding
   - Maintains consistent personality and style for each politician

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The debate follows a structured workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initialize Debate] --> B[Moderator Introduction]
    B --> C[First Speaker]
    C --> D{Check for Interruption}
    D -->|No Interruption| E[Fact Checker]
    D -->|Interruption| F[Handle Interruption]
    E --> G[Next Speaker Turn]
    F --> G
    G --> H{Topic Change?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Topic Manager]
    H -->|No| C
    I --> B
```

1. **Initialization**: The system configures the debate format, participants, and topic
2. **Introduction**: The moderator introduces the debate and first topic
3. **Speakers Take Turns**: Each politician speaks about the current topic
4. **Interruptions**: Politicians may interrupt each other based on statements
5. **Fact Checking**: Statements are verified for accuracy
6. **Topic Management**: The system transitions between subtopics
7. **Conclusion**: The moderator summarizes the debate after a set number of turns

## üí¨ Debate Formats

The system supports multiple debate formats:

### 1. Head-to-Head

Direct debate between two politicians with equal speaking time.

```bash
python aipolitician.py debate --format head_to_head --topic "Economy"
```

### 2. Town Hall

Format with audience questions and longer response times.

```bash
python aipolitician.py debate --format town_hall --topic "Healthcare"
```

### 3. Panel

Multiple politicians discuss topics with a moderator.

```bash
python aipolitician.py debate --format panel --topic "Foreign Policy"
```

---

## üöÄ Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9+ installed
2. CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended)
3. Appropriate Python packages installed

### Installation

1. Install the debate-specific dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-debate.txt
   ```

2. Ensure the chat and RAG system dependencies are also installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-chat.txt
   ```

3. Set up the ChromaDB directory (for RAG):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/chroma_db
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/chroma_db
   ```

### Running a Debate

There are two ways to run the debate system:

#### 1. Using the Unified Launcher (Recommended)

The easiest way to run a debate is through the unified launcher:

```bash
# Basic debate with default settings
python aipolitician.py debate

# Debate with specific topic
python aipolitician.py debate --topic "Climate Change"

# Debate with specific format
python aipolitician.py debate --format "town_hall" 

# Debate without RAG
python aipolitician.py debate --no-rag
```

#### 2. Using the LangGraph Script Directly

For advanced use cases, you can use the LangGraph script directly:

```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "General" --participants "biden,trump"
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of Memory Errors**:
   - Reduce the `--time-per-turn` parameter
   - Use the `--no-fact-check` flag to disable fact checking
   - Ensure you have a GPU with sufficient memory (min. 8GB recommended)

2. **Repetitive Responses**:
   - Try changing the topic to something more specific
   - Use more contentious topics that encourage disagreement
   - Ensure RAG system is working properly for factual grounding

3. **Model Loading Errors**:
   - Ensure all requirements are installed
   - Check that you have the latest model versions
   - Try running with `--no-rag` to bypass knowledge retrieval

4. **Incorrect Command Syntax**:
   - For simple usage, use `python aipolitician.py debate`
   - For advanced options, use `python langgraph_politician.py debate run`
   - Ensure you specify required arguments for the direct script approach

```

### Saving Debate Transcripts

Save the entire debate transcript to a file (advanced usage only):
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Economy" --participants "biden,trump" --output "economy_debate.json"
```

### Moderator Control Levels

You can specify different levels of moderator control (advanced usage only):
```bash
# Strict moderator (keeps debate focused, minimal interruptions)
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Healthcare" --participants "biden,trump" --moderator-control strict
```

### Workflow Visualization
