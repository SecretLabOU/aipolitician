## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The debate system is built on these key components:

1. **LangGraph Workflow**:
   - A directed graph that manages the flow of the debate
   - Handles turn-taking, interruptions, and topic transitions
   - Provides fact-checking and moderator intervention

2. **Agent Roles**:
   - **Moderator**: Controls the debate, introduces topics, and ensures fair time allocation
   - **Debaters**: AI Politicians (Biden, Trump) who respond to topics and each other
   - **Fact Checker**: Verifies statements and provides corrections
   - **Topic Manager**: Selects and transitions between subtopics

3. **Integration**:
   - Uses the same politician models as the chat system
   - Incorporates RAG for factual grounding
   - Maintains consistent personality and style for each politician

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The debate follows a structured workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initialize Debate] --> B[Moderator Introduction]
    B --> C[First Speaker]
    C --> D{Check for Interruption}
    D -->|No Interruption| E[Fact Checker]
    D -->|Interruption| F[Handle Interruption]
    E --> G[Next Speaker Turn]
    F --> G
    G --> H{Topic Change?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Topic Manager]
    H -->|No| C
    I --> B
```

1. **Initialization**: The system configures the debate format, participants, and topic
2. **Introduction**: The moderator introduces the debate and first topic
3. **Speakers Take Turns**: Each politician speaks about the current topic
4. **Interruptions**: Politicians may interrupt each other based on statements
5. **Fact Checking**: Statements are verified for accuracy
6. **Topic Management**: The system transitions between subtopics
7. **Conclusion**: The moderator summarizes the debate after a set number of turns

## üí¨ Debate Formats

The system supports multiple debate formats:

### 1. Head-to-Head

Direct debate between two politicians with equal speaking time.

```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --format head_to_head --participants "biden,trump" --topic "Economy"
```

### 2. Town Hall

Format with audience questions and longer response times.

```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --format town_hall --participants "biden,trump" --topic "Healthcare"
```

### 3. Panel

Multiple politicians discuss topics with a moderator.

```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --format panel --participants "biden,trump" --topic "Foreign Policy"
```

---

## üöÄ Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9+ installed
2. CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended)
3. Appropriate Python packages installed

### Installation

1. Install the debate-specific dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-debate.txt
   ```

2. Ensure the chat and RAG system dependencies are also installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-chat.txt
   ```

3. Set up the ChromaDB directory (for RAG):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/chroma_db
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/chroma_db
   ```

### Running a Debate

The debate system is implemented in `langgraph_politician.py` and uses the `debate` command with various subcommands:

#### Basic Usage

To start a default debate between Biden and Trump:
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "General" --participants "biden,trump"
```

#### With Specific Topic

To debate on a particular topic:
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Climate Change" --participants "biden,trump"
```

#### With Specific Format

To use a particular debate format:
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Immigration" --participants "biden,trump" --format "town_hall"
```

#### With Additional Options

```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Economy" --participants "biden,trump" --allow-interruptions --fact-check --moderator-control strict
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

| Component | Technology | Details |

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of Memory Errors**:
   - Reduce the `--time-per-turn` parameter
   - Use the `--no-fact-check` flag to disable fact checking
   - Ensure you have a GPU with sufficient memory (min. 8GB recommended)

2. **Repetitive Responses**:
   - Try changing the topic to something more specific
   - Use more contentious topics that encourage disagreement
   - Ensure RAG system is working properly for factual grounding

3. **Model Loading Errors**:
   - Ensure all requirements are installed
   - Check that you have the latest model versions
   - Try running with `--no-rag` to bypass knowledge retrieval

4. **Incorrect Command Syntax**:
   - Remember to use `langgraph_politician.py` not `aipolitician.py`
   - Include the `run` subcommand: `debate run`
   - Specify both `--topic` and `--participants` as required arguments

## üí° Example Topics

Try these debate topics for engaging simulations:

1. "Climate Change and Energy Policy"
2. "Immigration and Border Security"
3. "Healthcare Reform"
4. "Economic Recovery and Inflation"
5. "Foreign Policy and International Relations"
6. "Gun Control and Second Amendment"
7. "Education and Student Loan Debt"

Sample command:
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Climate Change and Energy Policy" --participants "biden,trump" --fact-check
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Saving Debate Transcripts

Save the entire debate transcript to a file:
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Economy" --participants "biden,trump" --output "economy_debate.json"
```

### Moderator Control Levels

You can specify different levels of moderator control:
```bash
# Strict moderator (keeps debate focused, minimal interruptions)
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Healthcare" --participants "biden,trump" --moderator-control strict

# Moderate control (balanced approach)
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Immigration" --participants "biden,trump" --moderator-control moderate

# Minimal control (more free-form, allows more interruptions)
python langgraph_politician.py debate run --topic "Foreign Policy" --participants "biden,trump" --moderator-control minimal
```

### Workflow Visualization

Generate a visual representation of the debate flow:
```bash
python langgraph_politician.py debate visualize
```

### Future Extensions

The debate system architecture is designed to be extensible:
- Add more politicians beyond Biden and Trump
- Implement different moderator personalities
- Create custom debate formats
- Support audience participation and questions
